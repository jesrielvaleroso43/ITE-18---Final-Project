# SlashSaber

## Project Story and Concept
SlashSaber is a 3D interactive game developed as a final project for ITE 18.
**Applications Development and Emerging Technologies (ITE-18)**.

The project focuses on demonstrating core concepts of **3D game development**
such as scene setup, object interaction, real-time rendering, and user input handling.
Players interact with objects inside a 3D environment, allowing them to experience
basic game mechanics and immersive interaction.

## Relevance to the Course
The project applies concepts such as:
- 3D scene creation
- Object interaction
- Camera and lighting setup
- Real-time updates and rendering

---

## Development Stack

The following tools and technologies were used in the development of the project:

- **Vue 3** – Used for organizing the application structure and components
- **Vite** – Development server and build tool for fast compilation
- **TypeScript** – Used for development-time error checking and code organization
- **Three.js concepts** – Used for 3D rendering, object creation, and interaction logic
- **SCSS (Sass)** – Used for styling, compiled into standard CSS
- **Vercel** – Used for deployment of the final application

---

## Features

- 3D scene initialization with camera and lighting
- Interactive objects within the scene
- User input handling (mouse / keyboard interaction)
- Real-time updates and rendering
- Modular and organized code structure

---

## How to play
- Slash obstacles with your sword using the mouse
- Some obstacles can only be slashed from one direction
- Game ends when you let 3 obstacles hit you

---

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

## Installation and Setup Guide
1. Clone repository to your local machine
2. Open terminal and `cd` into repository folder
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `vite` or `npm run dev`
